# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.
#
# Notes:
#
# We need to make a couple of updates for Redis
#
# 1. Need to increase somaxconn above its default value of 128
#    You cannot just do this:
#      sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=1024
#    Also, because /proc is mounted read-only, you must 
#    remount it as specified in item 3.
#
#    These constraints are not the same if you are deploying a single 
#    container via `docker run...` or if you are deploying via
#    `docker-compose up -d`.  Both of those methods have other
#    alternatives that are not available when deploying into
#    a swarm.
#
# 2. Need to disable THP (Transparent Huge Pages).
#    This change also requires an update to the
#    docker-compose.yml as shown in item 3.
#
# 3. Volume mounts in the docker-compose.yml file:
#
#    volumes:
#      - /proc:/writable-proc
#      - /sys:/writable-sys
#
# 4. There is one addtional setting to address the following
#    warning we saw when deploying from a Linux host:
#
#      WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! 
#      Background save may fail under low memory condition
#
#    The fix is so set vm.overcommit_memory = 1

# These are also done in the entrypoint script. They
# are included here in case we manually restart redis
# on the container for some reason.
